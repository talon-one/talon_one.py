    Talon.One API

    The Talon.One API is used to manage applications and campaigns, as well as to integrate with your application. The operations in the _Integration API_ section are used to integrate with our platform, while the other operations are used to manage applications and campaigns.  ### Where is the API?  The API is available at the same hostname as these docs. For example, if you are reading this page at `https://mycompany.talon.one/docs/api/`, the URL for the [updateCustomerProfile][] operation is `https://mycompany.talon.one/v1/customer_profiles/id`  [updateCustomerProfile]: #operation--v1-customer_profiles--integrationId--put   # noqa: E501
